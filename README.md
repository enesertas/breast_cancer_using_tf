I will be publishing nearly everything I do for a while about Computer Vision in this repository, starting from the very basics.

Since I wanted to improve myself in the field of Computer Vision I started taking a new course and will be following that course.

The files are Notebook files.

I am using Google Colab to create and edit the Notebooks.
